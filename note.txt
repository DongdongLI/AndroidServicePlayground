	functionality:
		1. click start to start the service 
		2. click work to trigger the heavy work
		3. click stop to stop the service
		
	
	
	In this working version, Message is abandoned for now since I cannot figure out how it works in both side
	
	instead, 
	
	in activity, a service reference is kept to call the function in it.
		(get it from binder)
		
	on the other hand, the service send out broadcast
	 and the activity have a BroadcastReceiver to take care the info
